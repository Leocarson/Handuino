# Sign Language + Arduino = Helpful robotics

This resporatory hosts the code for this project and also will host the 3d printing file when I make the complete version. Also, this will contain the complete instructions on how to build your own with an Arduino and a computer.

If you want to help work on this project and send some advice to me to help, my email is carsonkaucher@gmail.com

Current things I need fixed:
Takes two second between each letter
The robotic hand I am using is not at all like a hand
I am currently only spelling things out, I would like to make something like a sign language robot to fully sign things out

Parts to make one:
4M Robotic Hand Kit
5x Tower Pro Micro Servo 9g
4 AA baterry pack
Plenty of wires
An Arduino Uno (any other arduino based microcontroller should work)
A computer with python (Preferably a Windows PC or Linux Computer

You will need to change the usb port in the python code depending on where you plug in the arduino
